			<p class="fact">During this summer a wire from my electric box started smelling awkward but I did not notice till
			Ozzie managed to make me know that there was something wrong. If it was not for his help during that day
		  my house would have burned down. Is strange to see how a dog so small can save your life in a hard situation.

			<p>The Bichon Frise (pronounced BEE-shawn FREE-say; the plural is Bichons Frises)
				is a cheerful, small dog breed with a love of mischief and a lot of love to give.
				With his black eyes and fluffy white coat, the Bichon looks almost like a child’s toy.
				And it doesn’t take long to realize that the Bichon can be your happiest and most enthusiastic companion.</p>
